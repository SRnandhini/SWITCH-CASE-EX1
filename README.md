# SWITCH-CASE-EX1
switch-case is a multi-way decision making control structure in C. It allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases).  Each value is called a case.  The switch statement evaluates a variable or expression.  Depending on the result, the program jumps to the matching case.  If no case matches, default is executed.
